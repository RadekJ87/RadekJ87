### Hi there, I'm RadosÅ‚aw Janiszewski ðŸ‘‹


Since very early age I am interested of computers and all related technlogies. 
Programming is still something new to me. I started few years back at college, where I have gone through C++ and Java, 
but I seriously focused on it over 1 year ago when during the HTML&CSS course I've been introduced to JavaScript, that was it. 

I am mostly focusing on back-end side od JS, so Node.js and related frameworks like Express.js and Nest.js.
I know the basics of React, it is the next framework I am going to focus it to balance my skills.
